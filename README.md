Well, in short, my name is Simon.
I'm new to programming. However, i put a tremendous amount of time in order to improve my skills.
I was once a bodybuilder and to be honest, programming feels way more exciting!! Go brain muscles :P
It's been 3 monthes of non-stop C# programming for me and all i want is to develop myself.
I've come to a point where i have enough tools (knowledge) to work on some other people projects and of course on my projects as well.
Glad to be part of github!
